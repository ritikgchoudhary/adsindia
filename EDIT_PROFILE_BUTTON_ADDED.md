# Edit Profile Button Added to Dashboard

Hello! Based on your request, I have added an **Edit Profile** button to the User Dashboard.

## Changes Made:

1. **Dashboard Update** (`/user/dashboard`):
   - Located the Profile Card (Yellow/Orange gradient section).
   - Added a new button **"Edit Profile"** below the "Ads Skill India" badge.
   - Designed it with a semi-transparent white style to look perfect on the colorful background.
   - Added an icon (`fa-user-edit`) for better visibility.

2. **Functionality**:
   - Clicking the button takes the user to the **Profile Settings** page (`/user/profile-setting`).
   - On the Profile Settings page, users can:
     - Change their **Profile Photo** (click the camera icon).
     - Update their **First Name** and **Last Name**.
     - Update their Address details.

3. **Deploy Status**:
   - The changes have been applied and the frontend has been rebuilt.
   - You should see the new button immediately on the dashboard.

## Next Steps:
- You can now test the button by clicking it on the dashboard.
- Verify that users can successfully update their profile photo and name.

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
